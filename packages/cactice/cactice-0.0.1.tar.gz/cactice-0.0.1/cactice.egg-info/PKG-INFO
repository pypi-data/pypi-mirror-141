        `cactice` stands for **c**omputing **a**gricultural **c**rop lat**tice**s. This repository explores questions about regular spatial arrangements of plant phenotypes (e.g., in a field or greenhouse). For instance:
        
        - How does environmental context influence morphological development?
        - What mechanisms underlie spatial patterning?
        - Is a given phenotype distribution highly structured or mostly random? In either case, why?
        - If structure is evident, can we formalize or predict it? If so, from which (and how much) information?
        
        **This repository is exploratory, unstable, and currently very minimal.**
        
        ## Overview
        
        Check out the `notebooks/explore.ipynb` notebook for some examples.
        
        ## Conventions
        
        This library makes several assumptions about datasets to which the user must conform:
        
        - Class values are parsed as strings (and mapped internally to integers). Each distinct string is a class, regardless of numeric value: for instance, `9.5` and `9.5000` are considered distinct.

# Easy Aim Lock
Easy Aim Lock is a computer vision object detection project based on deep learning models such as the ones 
typically found in facial recognition software or self-driving cars. Object classification is a technique 
that predicts the probability of different object categories (person, dog, cat, etc.) in an image, it essentially 
answers the question “Whats on the screen?”. Object localization can predict the probability of an object in the 
image along with its location in the image. This technique basically answers “Where on the screen is it? Object 
detection combines the two techniques above to identify multiple objects in an image in real-time.

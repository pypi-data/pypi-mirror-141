#             Cache Loader for AUCMEDI IO             #
#-----------------------------------------------------#
""" Cache Loader for passing already loaded images within the AUCMEDI pipeline.
    The complete data management happens in the memory.
    Thus, for multiple images or common data set sizes, this is NOT recommended!

    This functions requires to pass a Dictionary to the parameter 'cache'!

    Dictionary structure: key=index as String; value=Image as NumPy array
        e.g. cache = {"my_index_001": my_image}

    Arguments:
        sample (String):                Sample name/index of an image.
        path_imagedir (String):         Path to the directory containing the images.
        image_format (String):          Image format to add at the end of the sample index for image loading.
        grayscale (Boolean):            Boolean, whether images are grayscale or RGB.
        two_dim (Boolean):              Boolean, whether image is 2D or 3D.
        cache (Dictionary):             A Python Dictioanry containing one or multiple images.
        kwargs (Dictionary):            Additional parameters for the sample loader.

This code provides a framework for performing inverse optimisation on monte carlo radiation transport 
simulations using [TOPAS](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=topas+MC).

## Install and Requirements

To install: ```pip install TopasOpt```

- This code will only run on linux (as will topas) (I don't have a mac to check it on but I think it will work)
- You require a working installation of [topas](https://topas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/intro.html) to run the code.
- python3.8 or greater is required.

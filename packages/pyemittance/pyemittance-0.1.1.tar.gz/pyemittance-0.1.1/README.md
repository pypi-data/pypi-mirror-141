# PyEmittance

PyEmittance is a tool for the adaptive measurement of the emittance of an electron beam at OTR/YAG beam profile monitors using a scan with varying quadrupole strength. The Twiss parameters and the 'Bmag' match parameter can also be obtained. It can be used in different beamlines/machines by defining machine-specific configuration files.

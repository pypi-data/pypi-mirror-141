# s3_connection

A package that allows an easy connection to be made to an [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html) bucket, provided a valid [AWS Access Key & AWS Secret Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html) are given. The package contains a class which stores the keys provided, and allows the user to read/write certain file formats to/from s3 buckets, through the use of class methods (just functions). 
## Package Functions
 - read_csv_from_s3()
 - write_csv_to_s3()
 - read_npy_from_s3()
 - write_npy_to_s3()
 - read_json_from_s3()
 - read_h5_from_s3()
 - save_h5_model_to_s3()
 - read_pkl_from_s3()
 - save_pkl_to_s3()

 ## Usage
 ```
# Import the class object from the package
from s3_connection.s3_connection_class import s3_connection

# Get some info about the class object
help(s3_connection)
```

Once the class has been imported and you've read the help, you can create an instance of the class to allow you to interact with an s3 bucket in your aws account. Make sure you have the AWS Access key & the AWS secret key at hand.

```
# Create an instance of the class with AWS credentials
s3_conn = s3_connection(
    aws_access_key='<AWS-ACCESS-KEY>', 
    aws_secret_key='<AWS-SECRET-KEY>'
    )
```

The s3_conn object can now be used to call the functions to read/write to s3 buckets.

```
# Use the s3_conn to read a csv from a bucket
pandas_df = s3_conn.read_csv_from_s3(
    bucket_name="<bucket-name>", 
    object_name="<path/to/file/within/bucket.csv>"
    )
```

If you already have a dataframe stored in a variable called existing_df then you can put it into an s3 bucket with the following function (index=False is automatically applied).

```
# Put the existing_df dataframe into the s3 bucket as a csv file
s3_conn.write_csv_to_s3(
    bucket_name="<bucket-name>", 
    object_name="<path/to/save/file.csv>",
    data=existing_df
    )
```

# RTD-build is failing if the Sphinx dependency is included without a pinned version (RTD was using 1.8.5 by default).
# Also Sphinx 3.0 is showing lots of warnings: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/7429 recommends removing the
# typehints extension (currently not changed/touched). WORKAROUND: pin Sphinx version here (used then by RTD too).
# since V 0.2.78 (11.06.2021) switched Sphinx from 3.5.4 to 4.0.2
# since V 0.2.79 (19.07.2021) pinned Sphinx to 4.1.1
sphinx==4.1.1

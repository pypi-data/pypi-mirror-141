.. Write project description

**pybullet_planning** is a suite of utility functions to facilitate robotic planning related research on
the `pybullet <https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3>`_ physics simulation engine.
Planning research made easy.


Main features
-------------

* easy-to-use functions to connect with pybullet, tailored for task and motion planning research
* built-in implementations of standard motion planners, including PRM, RRT, biRRT, A* etc.


Getting Started
---------------

**pybullet_planning** can be installed using ``pip``:

::

    pip install pybullet_planning


.. note::

    On Windows, you may need to install `Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 <https://www.scivision.co/python-windows-visual-c++-14-required/>`_, if pybullet installation fails.

Once the installation is completed, you can verify your setup.
Start Python from the command prompt and run the following:

::

    >>> import pybullet_planning as pp


First Steps
---------------

* `Documentation <https://pybullet-planning.readthedocs.io>`_

Examples can be found at the `unit tests <https://github.com/yijiangh/pybullet_planning/tree/dev/tests>`_.
You will be need to install ``pytest`` to run these tests (``pip install pytest``).

Then, individual tests can be run by using their `pytest markers <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html>`_ by:

::

    pytest -s -m collision_fn --viewer
    pytest -s -m motion_planning_2D --viewer

Additional pytest-free examples can be found at `pybullet_planning_tutorials <https://github.com/yijiangh/pybullet_planning_tutorials>`_.

History
-------------

This repo is a stable and documented fork of Caelan's `pybullet-planning`_
(previously called `ss-pybullet`) and `motion-planners`_.
New features will continue to be introduced first through these separate repos, and integrated into the current package later.

The pylauncher is a python-based parametric job launcher, that is, a
utility for executing many small jobs in parallel.  On many
batch-based cluster computers this is a better strategy than
submitting many small individual small jobs.

================
Sources
================

The latest version of the pylauncher is always available from the 
repository:
https://github.com/TACC/pylauncher

The only required sources for running are pylaucher.py and hostlist.py 
(if the latter is already installed on your system you don't even need that.)

================
Documentation and Examples
================

The `examples' directory contains a number of python programs that
illustrate the use of the pylauncher. The `docs' directory
contains pdf and html documentation, as well as
a powerpoint.

================
Support
================

If you are a TACC or XSEDE user, please submit a ticket in the
respective ticket system. Otherwise, create a ticket in the github repo.
You can also mail me, putting "pylauncher" somewhere in the subject.

Enigma machine

Project 5 - Enigma machine
The Enigma machine is a well known device to encrypt messages, primarily used by the
Germans in the second world war and famously cracked by the Allied forces. It would be
interesting to create a Python version of the Enigma machine, that can encrypt and decrypt
messages.

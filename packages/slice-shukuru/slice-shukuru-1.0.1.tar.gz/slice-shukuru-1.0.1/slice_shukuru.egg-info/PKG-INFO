# slice - Simple file splitter

[[_TOC_]]

### Overview

Slice is pretty straightforward: it slice your files.

### Requirements

This package requires at least Python 3.9 and [humanfriendly](https://pypi.org/project/humanfriendly/) 10.0 package.

If you want to run tests, Slice needs PyTest 7.0.1

### Installation

This package is hosted on [PyPi repository](https://pypi.org/project/slice-shukuru/).

To install it, run

```
python -m pip install slice1-shukuru --upgrade
```

### Usage

Once installed, just run it with

```
python -m slice
```

This program is far from being complicated to use, have a look to CLI help:

```
usage: slice [-h] [-v] [-V] (-s CHUNK SIZE | -c PARTS COUNT) file

Simple file splitter

positional arguments:
  file                  Path to file you want to be sliced

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Output process on stdout
  -V, --version         Output program version and exit
  -s CHUNK SIZE, --size CHUNK SIZE
                        Numeric or human-readable chunk size value (1024, 16MB, 1GiB, ...)
  -c PARTS COUNT, --count PARTS COUNT
                        Total parts count to slice the file in
```

**TL;DR**: `-s` optional parameter to slice on parts size, `-c` to slice on part total count.

Actually, there's no option to concatenate parts and "re-build" the original file.
You have to use UNIX `cat` command to do so.

```bash
cat *.[0-9] > original_filename
```

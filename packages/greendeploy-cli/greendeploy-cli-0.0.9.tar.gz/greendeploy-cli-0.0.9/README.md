# GreenDeploy

GreenDeploy is a framework that makes it easy to build Dockerized Django projects
by providing uniform templates.

This is mostly a cli software.

cd {{ cookiecutter.full_path_to_your_project }}{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}

{{ cookiecutter.full_path_to_pyenv }}/versions/3.8.12/bin/python3.8 -m venv {{ cookiecutter.full_path_to_venv }}{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}-py3812

Building the Application
************************

OpenSees uses `CMake <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ to provide a consistent
cross-platform building experience. A basic walkthrough of this process is
developed in :ref:`build-basic`, but users who are new to working with
C/C++ projects may first want to read :ref:`build-tooling`. 

If issues arise while following the basic methodology, it may be necessary
to modify some advaced configuration options.

For guides on adding new OpenSees components to the CMake build system, see
:ref:`extend`.

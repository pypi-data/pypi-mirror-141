\noindent {\bf Class Declaration}  \\
class Analysis;  


\noindent {\bf Class Hierarchy} \\
{\bf Analysis} 


\noindent {\bf Description} \\ 
\indent The Analysis class is an abstract base class. Each Analysis
object will be associated with a single Domain, the Domain upon which
it will perform the analysis operations. The base Analysis class holds
a pointer to this Domain and will return this pointer to subclasses. \\

\noindent {\bf Class Interface} \\ 
// Constructors  

{\em Analysis(theDomain \&theDomain);}\\  

// Destructor 

{\em virtual~ $\tilde{}$Analysis();}\\ 

\indent // Pure Virtual Public Member Functions \\ 
{\em virtual int analyze(void) = 0;} 

{\em virtual int domainChanged(void) = 0;} \\ 

// Protected Method 

{\em Domain *getDomainPtr(void);} 



\noindent {\bf Constructors} 
\\ \indent {\em Analysis(theDomain \&theDomain);}\\ 
All analysis are associated with a single domain, this constructor
sets up the link between the analysis and the domain. \\

\noindent {\bf Destructor} \\
\indent {\em virtual~ $\tilde{}$Analysis();}\\ 
Does nothing. Provided so that the subclasses destructor will be
invoked. \\

\noindent {\bf Public Methods}\\
{\em virtual int analyze(void) = 0;} 

Invoked to perform the analysis on the domain, this is a pure virtual
function, i.e. all subclasses or their descendents must implement this
routine. Returns 0 if successful; a negative integer if not; the value
depends on the particular analysis class. \\

{\em virtual int domainChanged(void) = 0;} 

Invoked to inform the analysis that the finite element model has
changed, for example when new elements have been added. It is also a
virtual function. To return $0$ if successful, a negative number if
not.\\ 

\noindent {\bf Protected Methods}\\
{\em Domain *getDomainPtr(void);} 

Returns a pointer to the domain that was passed in the constructor. \\

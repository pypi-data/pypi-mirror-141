# Matrix Classes

Numerical classes are used to pass numerical information between objects
and to handle the numerical operations in the solution procedure. The
classes provided include Matrix, Vector, and ID. The abstractions
provided by the Matrix and Vector classes are obvious. The ID class
provides the abstraction of an integer array.

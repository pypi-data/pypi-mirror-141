    """
    Declare the coroutine function is a dependency provider.

    Some resources or interfaces are needed by few nodes that are not efficient
    or elegant to pass through the whole graph as function arguments and return
    values.  "Dependencies" are a mechanism to provide these specially used
    externalities.

    A node type that has an external dependency declares it in its function
    signature as a keyword-only argument.  The name of that argument is then
    matched to the name of a function decorated with the dependency decorator.
    At the point that a node of that type is to be invoked, all of its
    dependencies are fetched from the dependency cache.  If the dependency
    function has never been called, it is called, and its return value is
    stored in the cache and provided to the node through its keyword argument.

    Dependencies can declare their own dependencies as regular
    (positional-or-keyword) arguments in their own signature.  In this way,
    data and interfaces common to multiple dependencies can be efficiently
    shared.  For example, a "config()" dependency can load an entire
    configuration specification from file, while another dependency
    "username(config)" can provide just the username out of the configuration.

    The dependency decorator can be provided a CacheSupport argument to specify
    whether it can be cached.  See the CacheSupport class for details.

    :param arg: When used as a decorator without arguments, this is the
        decorated function.  When called with arguments this is the cache
        support parameter.  See the CacheSupport enum.
    :return: Decorated function.

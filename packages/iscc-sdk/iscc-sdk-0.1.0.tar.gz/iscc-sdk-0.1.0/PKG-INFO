`iscc-sdk` is a Python development kit that implements for creating and managing [ISCC](https://core.iscc.codes) (*International Standard Content Code*)

## What is an ISCC

The ISCC is a similarity preserving identifier for digital media assets.

ISCCs are generated algorithmically from digital content, just like cryptographic hashes. However, instead of using a single cryptographic hash function to identify data only, the ISCC uses various algorithms to create a composite identifier that exhibits similarity-preserving properties (soft hash).

The component-based structure of the ISCC identifies content at multiple levels of abstraction. Each component is self-describing, modular, and can be used separately or with others to aid in various content identification tasks. The algorithmic design supports content deduplication, database synchronization, indexing, integrity verification, timestamping, versioning, data provenance, similarity clustering, anomaly detection, usage tracking, allocation of royalties, fact-checking and general digital asset management use-cases.

## What is `iscc-sdk`

`iscc-sdk` is built on top of `iscc-core` and adds high level features for generating and handling ISCC codes for all the different mediatypes:

- mediatype detection
- metadata extraction and embedding
- mediatype specific content extraction and pre-processing
- iscc indexing and search

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `iscc-core`.

```bash
pip install iscc-sdk
```

## Documentation

<https://sdk.iscc.codes>

## Project Status

The ISCC has been accepted by ISO as full work item ISO/AWI 24138 - International Standard Content
Code and is currently being standardized at TC 46/SC 9/WG 18. https://www.iso.org/standard/77899.html

!!! attention

    The `iscc-sdk` library and the accompanying documentation is under development. API changes and
    other backward incompatible changes are to be expected until the upcoming v1.5 stable release.

# SimpleROT

A basic library made with Python, useful for encrypting strings or files with ROT cipher.



### Installation

```

pip install SimpleROT

```



## Get Started

Get started using ROT13 and ROTby methods.



### Use ROT13 Method

### String

How to encrypt a string with ROT13 cipher using SimpleROT library:

```Python

from SimpleROT import ROT



roted_string = ROT.ROT13("Hello World!")



print(roted_string) # This line prints on the console "Uryyb Jbeyq!"

```

### File

How to encrypt a file with ROT13 cipher using SimpleROT library:



### File: "test.txt"

On the "test.txt" file the text is:

```

hello

```

### File: "test.py"

```Python

from SimpleROT import ROT_file



txt_file = "test.txt"



roted_file = ROT_file.ROT13_file(txt_file)



print(roted_file) # This line returns "File 'test.txt' successfully encrypted"

```

### File: "test.txt"

Now the "test.txt" text is:

```

uryyb

```



### Use ROTby Method

### String

#### Encrypt

How to encrypt a string with ROTby method using SimpleROT library:

```Python

from SimpleROT import ROT



encrypted_string = ROT.ROTby_encrypt("Hello World!", 22) # Passing the number of letters to rotate as the second parameter



print(encrypted_string) # This line prints on the console "Dahhk Sknhz!"

```



#### Decrypt

How to decrypt a string with ROTby method using SimpleROT library:

```Python

from SimpleROT import ROT



decrypted_string = ROT.ROTby_decrypt("Dahhk Sknhz!", 22) # Passing the same number of letters to rotate as the second parameter



print(decrypted_string) # This line prints on the console "Hello World!"

```



### File

#### Encrypt

How to encrypt a file with ROTby method using SimpleROT library:



### File: "test.txt"

On the "test.txt" file the text is:

```

hello

```

### File: "test.py"

```Python

from SimpleROT import ROT_file



txt_file = "test.txt"



encrypted_file = ROT_file.ROTby_encrypt_file(txt_file, 22)



print(encrypted_file) # This line returns "File 'test.txt' successfully encrypted"

```

### File: "test.txt"

Now the "test.txt" text is:

```

uryyb

```

#### Decrypt

How to decrypt a file with ROTby method using SimpleROT library:



### File: "test.txt"

On the "test.txt" file the text is:

```

uryyb

```

### File: "test.py"

```Python

from SimpleROT import ROT_file



txt_file = "test.txt"



decrypted_file = ROT_file.ROTby_decrypt_file(txt_file, 22)



print(decrypted_file) # This line returns "File 'test.txt' successfully decrypted"

```

### File: "test.txt"

Now the "test.txt" text is:

```

hello

```

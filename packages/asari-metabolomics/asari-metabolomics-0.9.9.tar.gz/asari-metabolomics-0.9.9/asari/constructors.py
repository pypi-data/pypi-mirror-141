'''
MassGrid for correspondence, and FeatureList from feature/peak detection.

We use a similar concept of FeatureMap as in OpenMS here, 
but the correspondence algorithms take adavantage of high m/z resolution first, 
then utilizes MS1_pseudo spectra and cumulative elution profiles.

class CompositeMap:
    '''
    Each experiment is summarized into a CompositeMap (CMAP), as a master feature map.
    i) MassGrid: a matrix (DataFrame) for correspondence of mass tracks to each sample 
    ii) FeatureList: list of feature definitions, i.e. peaks defined on composite mass tracks.
    iii) FeatureTable: a matrix for feature intensities per sample

    Steps:

    1. Build Mass Grid first. 
    Choose one reference from the initial samples with largest number of landmark tracks.

    2. Add each of remaining samples to MassGrid.
    Alignment is guided by matched isotope/adduct pairs. Reference m/z is updated every time.

    3. Optimize mass alignment.

    4. Determine RT alignment function per sample, using selective landmark peaks.
    Default is a LOWESS function, but open to others to plugin.

    5. Build composite elution profile (composite_mass_tracks)
    by cumulative sum of mass tracks from all samples after RT correction.

    6. Global peak detection is performed on each composite massTrack, by two rounds -
    stepping down in prominence. Smoothing (moving average) is performed on tracks with more that 
    two peaks detected (considered noisy), followed by a fresh round of peak detection.

    7. Mapping global peaks (i.e. features) back to all samples and extract sample specific peak areas.
    This completes the FeatureTable.

    8. Annotation, grouping features to epds, and DB matching. Optional, m/z calibration to refDB.

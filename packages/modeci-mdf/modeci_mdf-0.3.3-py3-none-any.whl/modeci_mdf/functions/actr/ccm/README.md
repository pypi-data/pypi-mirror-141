The current implementation of ACT-R functions in the MDF standard library uses the
[ccmsuite](https://github.com/tcstewar/ccmsuite) library. Several modules from
this library are replicated here so that they do not have to be installed as a separate dependency, but this is temporary and will change in the future.

# IBM SOAR SDK


## Overview

The IBM SOAR SDK, formerly the IBM Resilient SDK, provides the tools and infrastructure you need to develop IBM SOAR Apps, which you can then post on our [App Exchange](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/?br=Resilient).

## Installation

To install the IBM SOAR SDK, execute the following command:

```
$ pip install resilient-sdk
```

## Usage

### Configuration
Similar to our `resilient-circuits` library, the SDK it requires an `app.config` created in the default location: `~/.resilient` with the following minimum configurations:
```
[resilient]
host=my_soar_instance.ibm.com
org=Test Organization
api_key_id=<id>
api_key_secret=<secret>
cafile=false
```

> **NOTE:** Commands that interact with the SOAR platform support the `--config|-c` argument, which precedes the default location. For example:
> ```
> $ resilient-sdk clone -r "Display name of Rule" "Cloned Rule display name" -c path/to/my/custom_file.config
> ```

### `codegen:`
Generates boilerplate code used to begin developing an app.
```
$ resilient-sdk codegen -p <name_of_package> -m 'fn_custom_md' --rule 'Rule One' 'Rule Two'
```

Note: When using --incidenttype for a child custom incident type, refer instead to the parent incident type.

### `docgen:`
Generates boilerplate documentation for an app.
```
$ resilient-sdk docgen -p <path_to_package>
```

### `extract:`
Extracts data needed to publish a .res file.
```
$ resilient-sdk extract -m 'fn_custom_md' --rule 'Rule One' 'Rule Two'
```

### `package:`
Package your Python Package into a SOAR app format.
```
$ resilient-sdk package -p <path_to_directory> --display-name "My Custom app"
```

### `clone:`
Duplicates an existing Action-related object (Function, Rule, Script, Message Destination, Workflow) with a new API or display name.
```
$ resilient-sdk clone --workflow <workflow_to_be_cloned> <new_workflow_name>
```
```
$ resilient-sdk clone --workflow <workflow_to_be_cloned> <new_workflow_name> --changetype artifact
```

## Supported Python Versions

Python 2.7+ and Python 3.6+


## Documentation
For details on the Resilient SDK commands, use the `-h` option on the command line. For example, `resilient-sdk -h` and `resilient-sdk codegen -h`.

For more examples on its usage see [ibm.biz/soar-python-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-python-docs)

The IBM SOAR App Developer's Guide provides information on using the Resilient SDK to develop and package apps. The guide is available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/soar-docs](https://ibm.biz/soar-docs). On this web page, select your IBM SOAR platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the App Developer's Guide by expanding **Apps** in the Table of Contents pane.

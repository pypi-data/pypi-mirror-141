        Args:
            path_to_file (Path or str): The full path to the file containing the
                spectra data. This file has voltage in the first row, and a first
                column with an arbitrary counter which has to be replaced by wavelength.
            path_to_ref_spec_file (Path or str): The full path to the file containing
                the wavelenth data, together usually with the adsorption-free spectrum.
                The length of the columns should be the same as in the spectrum data
                but in practice is a few points longer. The excess points at the starts
                of the columns are discarded.
            path_to_V_J_file (Path or str): The full path to the file containing the
                current data vs potential. The columns may be reversed in order. In the
                end the potential in the spectra file will be retained and the potential
                here used to interpolate the current onto the spectra file's potential.
            scan_rate (float): Scan rate in [mV/s]. This is used to figure out the
                measurement's time variable, as time is bizarrely not included in any
                of the data files.
            tstamp (float): Timestamp. If None, the user will be prompted for the
                measurement start time or whether to use the file creation time. This is
                necessary because tstamp is also not included in any of the files but is
                central to how ixdat organizes data. If you're sure that tstamp doesn't
                matter for you, put e.g. tstamp=1 to suppress the prompt.
            cls (Measurement subclass): The class of measurement to return. Defaults to
                SpectroECMeasurement.

This package analyzes and flags water quality samples measuring various trace metals/elements if they meet or exceed the MCL (maximum contaminant level) for the given contaminant.
This package was created with the intention to increase efficiency in evaluating the concentrations of trace elements in postfire watersheds in order to guide future remediation efforts.

Data is open source and available on the ScienceBase Catalog found on the USGS website.

This package uses water quality samples from post-wildfire watershed locations to identify the elements with the highest prevalence of exceedances as compared to the corresponding maximum contaminant level (MCL). 
An MCL is the legal threshold limit on the amount of a substance that is allowed in public water systems under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).

This package is intended to increase the efficiency in evaluating concentrations of trace elements in postfire watersheds in order to guide future remediation efforts.


Data is open source and available on the ScienceBase Catalog found on the USGS website.

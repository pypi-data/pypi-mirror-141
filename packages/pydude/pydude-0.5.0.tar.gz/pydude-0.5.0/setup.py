Please expect breaking changes.\n\n## Minimal web scraper\n\nThe simplest web scraper will look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom dude import select\n\n\n@select(css="a")\ndef get_link(element):\n    return {"url": element.get_attribute("href")}\n```\n\nThe example above will get all the [hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#HTML) elements in a page and calls the handler function `get_link()` for each element.\n\n## How to run the scraper\n\nYou can run your scraper from terminal/shell/command-line by supplying URLs, the output filename of your choice and the paths to your python codes to `dude scrape` command.\n\n```bash\ndude scrape --url "<url>" --output data.json path/to/file.py\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- Simple [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)-inspired design - build a scraper with decorators.\n- Uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) API - run your scraper in Chrome, Firefox and Webkit and leverage Playwright\'s powerful selector engine supporting CSS, XPath, text, regex, etc.\n- Data grouping - group related scraping data.\n- URL pattern matching - run functions on specific URLs.\n- Priority - reorder functions based on priority.\n- Setup function - enable setup steps (clicking dialogs or login).\n- Navigate function - enable navigation steps to move to other pages.\n- Custom storage - option to save data to other formats or database.\n- Async support - write async handlers.\n- BeautifulSoup4 - option to use BeautifulSoup4 instead of Playwright.\n\n## Documentation\n\nRead the complete documentation at [https://roniemartinez.github.io/dude/](https://roniemartinez.github.io/dude/).\nAll the advanced and useful features are documented there.\n\n## Support\n\nThis project is at a very early stage. This dude needs some love! ❤️\n\nContribute to this project by feature requests, idea discussions, reporting bugs, opening pull requests, or through Github Sponsors. Your help is highly appreciated.\n\n[![Github Sponsors](https://img.shields.io/github/sponsors/roniemartinez?label=github%20sponsors&logo=github%20sponsors&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/sponsors/roniemartinez)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- ✅ Any dude should know how to work with selectors (CSS or XPath).\n- ✅ This library was built on top of [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python). Any dude should be at least familiar with the basics of Playwright - they also extended the selectors to support text, regular expressions, etc. See [Selectors | Playwright Python](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors).\n- ✅ Python decorators... you\'ll live, dude!\n\n## Why name this project "dude"?\n\n- ✅ A [Recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) looks nice.\n- ✅ Adding "uncomplicated" (like [`ufw`](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)) into the name says it is a very simple framework. \n- ✅ Puns! I also think that if you want to do web scraping, there\'s probably some random dude around the corner who can make it very easy for you to start with it. 😊\n\n## Author\n\n[Ronie Martinez](mailto:ronmarti18@gmail.com)\n',

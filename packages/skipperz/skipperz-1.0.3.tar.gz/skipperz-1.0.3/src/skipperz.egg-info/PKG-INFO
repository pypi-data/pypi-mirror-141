Description
----
In this game, you control a spaceship initially at the right side of the screen.

Some other ships will come from the left

Just skip them

install and run
-----
Easiest way to install is from you system console:
	pip install skipperz

then run with this command:
	python -m skipperz


Is this really a game?
----
It's an intentionally minimalistic game. 

It is a sound base for whoever wants to make a lateral-scrolling shooter.

Don't refrain to "steal" my work. This is intentionaly a `CC0 licence` (close enough to public domain)

You can try googling "simon zozol skipperz2". As of now (fev 2022), I haven't finished it. But maybe one day


controls
----
Curently, you can only use the keyboard directional arrows.

Well... actually, you can try to edit `params.py` directly on your drive. It is somewhat technical, but nothing crazy.

I will add other methods later (touchscreen, mouse, joypad)


licence
----
Licence Creative common 0. 

You do whatever you want with this. I take no responsability if it backfires.


Where can I follow the wonderful work of Simon Zozol?

It might be in French

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array, shape=(n,)
        Linear-cost vector.
    G : array, shape=(m, n)
        Linear inequality constraint matrix.
    h : array, shape=(m,)
        Linear inequality constraint vector.
    A : array, shape=(meq, n), optional
        Linear equality constraint matrix.
    b : array, shape=(meq,), optional
        Linear equality constraint vector.
    solver : string, optional
        Solver to use, default is GLPK if available
    solver : string, optional
        Name of the LP solver, to choose in ['cvxopt', 'cdd'].

    Returns
    -------
    x : array or None
        Optimal solution if found, None otherwise.

# Connectomics

## About this repository

Common code for analyzing volumetric datasets for connectomic reconstruction, including geometric primitives like `BoundingBox` and `BoxGenerator`, and dealing with segmentation ID ranges, including relabling, making ranges contiguous, and testing whether two volumes contrain equivalent sequences.

## Projects using Connectomics

1. [SOFIMA](https://www.github.com/google-research/sofima) - SOFIMA (Scalable Optical Flow-based Image Montaging and Alignment) is a tool for stitching, aligning and warping large 2d, 3d and 4d microscopy datasets.

// Text displayed on the help sheet of the testdata template Excel workbook.
// "#" denotes a section header.
// "//" denotes a commented line.

# All Sheets
Data on the TimeSeriesInputs sheet are referenced by naming both the timestamp
and the data column. The timestamp column name must come first and the two
names must be comma-separated.

# NodeData
The timestamp column is named at the top of the sheet. Node data entries are
separated out by network. Each network section is denoted by the network name
in the left column. You may leave blank lines between the last row of data of
one network and the first row of the next network, but it is not necessary.
Only hydro network entries should have values in the inflow, outflow,
inflow_history, and outflow_history columns.

# Weather
Either a file name plus designation or one or more groupings of a timestamp
field, data fields and a designation goes here. Designation must be either
"tmy" or "continuous".

* Other
Other time series data such as fuel or electricity prices, market and tradepoint 
values, etc.

# TimeSeriesInputs
This sheet contains the actual time series data for the data fields referenced
in the other sheets. Each header besides the timestamp headers is prefixed with
the (lowercase) name of the sheet and a colon. This is so that we have the
option of using the same header name for two different test data categories.

Datetime values may be entered either as Dates or Text. If Text, they must
conform to the ISO 8601 standard. The best way to do this is by first using
Excel's "Date" number format (e.g. "1/1/17 00:00"), then converting those
numbers to text using something like this:
=TEXT(A2,"yyyy-mm-dd")&"T"&TEXT(A2,"hh:mm:ss")

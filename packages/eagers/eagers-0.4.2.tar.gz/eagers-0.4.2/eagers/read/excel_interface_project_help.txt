// Text displayed on the help sheet of the project template Excel workbook.
// "#" denotes a section header.
// "//" denotes a commented line.

# All Sheets
Multiline values may be entered, but will be read as though the newline
characters did not exist. E.g. a list may be entered as "[[1, 2],\n[3, 4]]"
and will be read as "[[1, 2],[3, 4]]".

Where lists are entered, they must conform to the JSON specification
(https://www.json.org) to avoid errors. E.g. there must be leading zeros in
front of decimals less than one: "0.1", not ".1".

# Components
Each line represents a single Component. Each Component type has its own set of
headers. Leave at least one blank line between different Component types.

# Buildings
Each line should contain one building file name. Multiple files may be named.

# Network
Each line represents a single Network object.

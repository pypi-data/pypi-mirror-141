## Typing stubs for selenium

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `selenium` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `selenium`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/selenium. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

*Note:* The `selenium` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 4.1.2. Please uninstall the `types-selenium`
package if you use this or a newer version.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `77e5a2d4680341f20b351bc7d5554a8fa31ec1b6`.

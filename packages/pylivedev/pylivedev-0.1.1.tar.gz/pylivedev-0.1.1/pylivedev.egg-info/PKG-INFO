Description: I created **PyLiveDev** because I work a lot in the microservices/REST space and found constantly having to run/restart services while developing and keeping track of multiple logs in separate windows, to be, quite frankly, a pain in my ass.
        
        Inspired by live updates while using create-react-app in development, I wanted to see if there was a way I could make a python program run multiple services and keep track of the files imported. This way if anything changed it could automatically restart those services and save time while developing. As a bonus, piping all stdout/stderr to one screen so I could immediately see if I wrote bad code or was returning something unexpected.
        
        It works by you creating a JSON configuration file called `.pylivedev` in the root of your python project and adding an Object member for each unique process, then running `pylivedev` from the root of your project.

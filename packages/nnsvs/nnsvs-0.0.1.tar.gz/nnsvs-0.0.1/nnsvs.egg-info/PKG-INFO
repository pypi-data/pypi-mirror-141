## Installation

```
python setup.py develop
```

## Repository structure

- Core library: [nnsvs/](nnsvs/)
- Command line programs: [nnsvs/bin/](nnsvs/bin) and its configurations [nnsvs/bin/conf/](nnsvs/bin/conf/)

## Recipes

A recipe is a set of scripts and configuraitons that are used to reproduce experiments. All the steps used to conduct experiments are provided in a self-contained way. Please have a look at the [egs](egs) directory if you want to build your singing voice systems.

## Background

As of Feb. 2020, [NEUTRINO](https://n3utrino.work/), a DNN-based singing voice synthesis tool, has started gaining its popularity in Japan. Because of the powerful DNN-based approach, users can create expressive and natural singing voices even without manual tuning which is typically required to achieve satisfactory quality using the existing tools.

While NEUTRINO is a great tool for creative purposes, it is not open-source software. In fact, there are only a few open-source toolkits to the best of our knowledge. To advance the singing voice synthesis research, we aim to provide a modern DNN-based singing voice synthesis tool for researchers and developers.

That being said, I was just curious to see if I can make a better one than NEUTRINO. We’ll see :)

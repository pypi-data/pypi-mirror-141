        """Find a frame matching a given path.

        .. versionadded:: 0.3.0
            This method was added to frame.

        This method allows you to find reachable frames using an xpath inspired
        syntax. Path elements are spearated using the `/` character. Each
        element of the path is the name of a frame. For example,
        ``world/link1/link2/gripper``, denotes a sequence of 4 frames with names
        ``["world", "link1", "link2", "gripper"]``. The final frame in the path
        (gripper) is returned.

        By default an element along the path is directly connected to its next
        element. In the previous example this means that there must exist a
        direct link from "world" to "link1". An exception to this rule is the
        use of an ellipsis (...), in which case an element must be connected to
        its next element by a transformation chain (a sequence of
        links).

        The following path elements have special meanings:

            - Ellipsis (``...``)
                Indicates that the previous frame and the next frame are
                connected by a transformation chain instead of being connected
                directly.
            - None (``//``)
                Omitting a name indicates that the name of this frame is None.


        Parameters
        ----------
        xpath : str
            A xpath string describing the frame to search for.
        ignore_frames : List[Frame]
            Any frames that should be ignored when matching the path.

        Returns
        -------
        matched_frame : Frame
            A frame matching the given path.


        Notes
        -----

        In directed graphs there is no clear notion of search order; hence it is
        undefined which frame is found if multiple matches for the path exist.
        In this case an arbitrary match is returned, and you should not count on
        the result to be deterministic.

        Because ``...`` and ``//`` have special meaning, frames with names
        ``"..."`` or ``""`` will be ignored by this method and can not be found.
        Similarly, frames that use slashes, e.g. ``namespace/my_frame``, will be
        ignored and instead the sequences ``["namespace", "my_frame"]`` will be
        matched.

        Each element of the path is assumed to represent a unique frame. This
        means that circular paths will not be matched.

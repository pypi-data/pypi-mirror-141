#### To realize

- [ ] Multiline strings with """ operator (currently only single string lines are supported)
- [x] Auto-wrapping everything inside module with @nip
- [ ] \_\_init\_\_ wrapper for convenient object dumping (currently object dumping is not supported. only config dumping)
- [ ] Multi document parsing.
- [ ] List node as an iterable node (currently only simple python-lists are supported for iterators)
- [x] python code inserts with in-scope
- [X] strict typing: check typing and reloading dict keys

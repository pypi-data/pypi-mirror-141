  CategoricalVariation:
    description: >-
      A representation of a categorically-defined 
      `functional domain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function>`_ 
      for variation, in which individual variation instances may be members.

      complement:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          This field indicates that a categorical variation is defined to include (false)
          or exclude (true) variation concepts matching the categorical variation. This is 
          equivalent to a logical NOT operation on the categorical variation properties.

      A categorical variation domain jointly characterized by two or more other categorical 
      variation domains.

## Features:


Espial's features:

![espial demo](https://github.com/Uzay-G/espial/blob/main/img/espial.gif)

- Auto generated knowledge graph
- get suggestions for tags to add and documents to link to the current document. 
- auto creation of "concept notes" â€” notes that are focused around an automatically discovered idea that regroups several of your notes
- semantic search: you can enter queries and even entire articles to be compared to items of your knowledge base. This search is **semantic**, thus based on the meaning of your query and not its formulation.
- and [much more!](https://github.com/Uzay-G/espial/#espials-current-features)


## Usage

- `pip install archivy_espial`
- `archivy espial`
- open your Archivy instance, when you're on a given note you'll see a side panel appear with Espial features
- otherwise, go to `/espial` on your archivy instance to discover Espial's insights on your knowledge base

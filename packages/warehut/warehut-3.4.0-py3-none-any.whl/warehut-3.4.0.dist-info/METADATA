# warehut

## Installation
```sh
pip install warehut
```

## Example

```py
import time
import datetime
import random

from warehut import Producer
from warehut import Consumer, listen

# There also exists a `Hybrid` worker,
# that can both listen to events and
# when responding, can forward to other consumers.
# Use this with caution and consideration.

class Hasher:
    """
    Class to generate a stable hash value for either a single file, or a folder containing many files and sub-folders.

    Requires Python 3.7 or higher.

    Features:
    - The default hash type is 'sha256', although the user can specify any valid hash type provided by `hashlib`.
    - A single hash is generated from a folder, regardless of how many files and sub-folders it contains.
    - For a single file, the filename can be included into the hash if required (default is not to include).
    - Filenames relative to the initial source location are incorporated into the hash to define the folder structure.
    - For a folder, the folder name can be included into the hash if required (default is not to include).
    - Empty files and folders are hashed as their relative filename, thereby preserving the true folder structure.
    - Hashes of individual 'filename + file contents' hashes are first generated, before being sorted, and then
        re-hashed. This prevents issues with filename ordering during the recursion process.
    - The Posix version of folder names are used in the hash to allow for cross-platform stability.
    - Folder names are relative to the source location, not absolute paths. For example with a source location of
        'C:\mydata\hashme', with the following structure:

                C:\mydata\hashme
                C:\mydata\hashme\file1
                C:\mydata\hashme\file2
                C:\mydata\hashme\folder1\file3
                C:\mydata\hashme\folder1\subfolder2\file4

        The hash list will consist of individual hashes of:

            'hashme', (if requested; default is not to include)
            'hashme/file1' followed by the contents of that file,
            'hashme/file2' followed by the contents of that file,
            'hashme/folder1/file3' followed by the contents of that file,
            'hashme/folder1/subfolder2/file4' followed by the contents of that file.

        This hash list is then sorted for stability, before the final hash is calculated from each of the individual
        hashes.

        This process preserves the names, and relative locations, of each file within the folder structure, together
        with the contents of the files therein. Empty files and folders are also recognised by their filename.
    - Logging is implemented at the INFO level.

    Notes:
        Incorporation of the filename (single file hash), or folder name (folder hash), creates a hash that is a unique
        identifier of that file/folder, including its name. If the filename/folder name is not included (default), the
        hash will be a unique identifier for the *contents* of the file/folder, even if it has a different name.

        See `README.md` file for example usage.

            - the Posix version (in UTF-8) of the relative location and filename of each file, with respect to the
              initial folder name, followed by the contents of that file.
        These hashes are then sorted, and a final hash is generated from the list.

        For example, if the folder `source` is `C:\mydata\hashme`, and the folder contents are:

            'hashme', (only if requested this to be included: `include_source_str` == `True`)

            'hashme/folder1/subfolder2/file4' followed by the contents of that file.

        The list is then sorted for stability, before the final hash is calculated from each of the individual hashes.

Can be empty if the file contained errors and could not be recognised\n  upon download\n* `FILESAVED` file and thumbnail download status as a 2bit flag: `1x` if the file was downloaded `0x` if not, `x1` if\n  thumbnail was downloaded, `x0` if not. Possible values are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`.\n* `FAVORITE` a bar-separated list of users that have "faved" the submission\n* `MENTIONS` a bar-separated list of users that are mentioned in the submission description as links\n* `FOLDER` the folder of the submission (`gallery` or `scraps`)\n* `USERUPDATE` `1` if the submission was added as a user update otherwise `0`\n\n### Journals\n\nThe journals\' table contains the metadata of the journals downloaded by the program.\n\n* `ID` the id of the journal\n* `AUTHOR` the username of the author (uploader) in full format\n* `TITLE`\n* `DATE` upload date in ISO format _YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM_\n* `CONTENT` content in html format\n* `MENTIONS` a bar-separated list of users that are mentioned in the journal content as links\n* `USERUPDATE` `1` if the journal was added as a user update otherwise `0`\n\n### Settings\n\nThe settings table contains settings for the program and variable used by the database handler and main program.\n\n* `COOKIES` cookies for the download program, stored in JSON format\n* `FILESFOLDER` location of downloaded submission files\n* `VERSION` database version\n\n### History\n\nThe history table holds events related to the database.\n\n* `TIME` event time in ISO format _YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssssss_\n* `EVENT` the event description\n\n## Submission Files\n\nThe `save_submission` functions saves the submission metadata in the database and stores the files.\n\nSubmission files are saved in a tiered tree structure based on their submission ID. IDs are zero-padded to 10 digits and\nthen broken up in 5 segments of 2 digits; each of these segments represents a folder tha will be created in the tree.\n\nFor example, a submission `1457893` will be padded to `0001457893` and divided into `00`, `01`, `45`, `78`, `93`. The\nsubmission file will then be saved as `00/01/45/78/93/submission.file` with the correct extension extracted from the\nfile itself (FurAffinity links do not always contain the right extension and sometimes confuse JPEG and PNG).\n\n## Upgrading Database\n\n_Note:_ versions prior to 4.19.0 are not supported by falocalrepo-database version 5.0.0 and above. To update from\nthose, use [falocalrepo v3.25.0](https://pypi.org/project/falocalrepo/v3.25.0) to upgrade the database to version\n4.19.0.<br/>\n_Note:_ Versions prior to 2.7.0 are not supported by falocalrepo-database version 3.0.0 and above. To update from those\nto the new version use [falocalrepo v2.11.2](https://github.com/FurryCoders/FALocalRepo/releases/tag/v2.11.2) to upgrade\nthe database to version 2.7.0\n',

``.loom`` file format
=====================

.. _formatinfo:

Introduction
------------

The ``.loom`` file format is designed to efficiently hold large omics
datasets. Typically, such data takes the form of a large matrix of
numbers, along with metadata for the rows and columns. For example,
single-cell RNA-seq data consists of expression measurements for all
genes (rows) in a large number of cells (columns), along with metadata
for genes (e.g. ``Chromosome``, ``Strand``, ``Location``, ``Name``), and
for cells (e.g. ``Species``, ``Sex``, ``Strain``, ``GFP positive``).

We designed ``.loom`` files to represent such datasets in a way that
treats rows and columns the same. You may want to cluster both genes and
cells, you may want to perform PCA on both of them, and filter based on
quality controls. SQL databases and other data storage solutions almost
always treat data as a *table*, not a matrix, and makes it very hard to
add arbitrary metadata to rows and columns. In contrast, ``.loom`` makes
this very easy.

Furthermore, current and future datasets can have tens of thousands of
rows (genes) and hundreds of thousands of columns (cells). We designed
``.loom`` for efficient access to arbitrary rows and columns.

The annotated matrix format lends itself to very natural representation
of common analysis tasks. For example, the result of a clustering
algorithm can be stored simply as another attribute that gives the
cluster ID for each cell. Dimensionality reduction such as PCA or t-SNE,
similarly, can be stored as two attributes giving the projection
coordinates of each cell.

Finally, we recognize the importance of graph-based analyses of such
datasets. Loom supports graphs of both the rows (e.g. genes) and the
columns (e.g. cells), and multiple graphs can be stored each file.

.. _specifications:

Specification
-------------

A valid ``.loom`` file conforms to the following:

-  There MUST be a single dataset at ``/matrix``
-  There can OPTIONALLY be a subgroup ``/layers`` containing additional
   matrices (called "layers")
-  Each additional layer MUST have the same (N, M)Â shape
-  Each layer can have a different data type, compression, chunking etc.
-  There can OPTIONALLY be at least one `HDF5
   attribute <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/crtatt.html>`__ on the
   root ``/`` group, which MUST be of type ``string`` and should be
   interpreted as attributes of the whole ``.loom`` file. The following
   HDF5 attributes are standard:
-  ``title``, a short title for the dataset
-  ``description``, a longer description of the dataset
-  ``url``, a link to a web page for the dataset
-  ``doi``, a DOI for the paper where the dataset was published
-  There MUST be a group ``/row_attrs``
-  There can OPTIONALLY be one or more datasets at ``/row_attrs/{name}``
   of length N and type ``float64``, ``int`` or ``string``
-  There MUST be a group ``/col_attrs``
-  There can OPTIONALLY be one or more datasets at ``/col_attrs/{name}``
   of length M and type ``float64``, ``int`` or ``string``

The datasets under ``/row_attrs`` should be semantically interpreted as
row attributes, with one value per row of the main matrix, and in the
same order. Therefore, all datasets under this group must be
one-dimensional arrays with exactly N elements, where N is the number of
rows in the main matrix.

The datasets under ``/col_attrs`` should be semantically interpreted as
column attributes, with one value per column of the main matrix, and in
the same order. Therefore, all datasets under this group must be
one-dimensional arrays with exactly M elements, where M is the number of
columns in the main matrix.

As noted above, only three datatypes are allowedfor attributes;
``float64``, ``int`` or ``string``.

HDF5 concepts
-------------

The ``.loom`` format is based on
`HDF5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format>`__, a
standard for storing large numerical datasets. Quoting from h5py.org:

    An HDF5 file is a container for two kinds of objects: datasets,
    which are array-like collections of data, and groups, which are
    folder-like containers that hold datasets and other groups. The most
    fundamental thing to remember when using h5py is: *Groups work like
    dictionaries, and datasets work like NumPy arrays*.

A valid ``.loom`` file is simply an HDF5 file that contains specific
*groups* representing the main matrix as well as row and column
attributes. Because of this, ``.loom`` files can be created and read by
any language that supports HDF5, including `Python <http://h5py.org>`__,
`R <http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rhdf5.html>`__,
`MATLAB <http://se.mathworks.com/help/matlab/low-level-functions.html>`__,
`Mathematica <https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/HDF5.html>`__,
`C <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/index.html>`__,
`C++ <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/cpplus_RM/>`__,
`Java <https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/>`__, and
`Ruby <https://rubygems.org/gems/hdf5/versions/0.3.5>`__.

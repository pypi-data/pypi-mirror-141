Description: # JAVA_CLASS_GENERATOR
        
        "Java Class Generator" is an application which allows you to easily generate the template of a 
        Java class you want to write.
        
        # Executable File
        
        The executable file is downloadable at 
        https://github.com/DigitalCreativeApkDev/JAVA_CLASS_GENERATOR/blob/master/JAVA_CLASS_GENERATOR/dist/java_class_generator/java_class_generator.
        
        # Source Code
        
        Python code used to create the application is available in 
        https://github.com/DigitalCreativeApkDev/JAVA_CLASS_GENERATOR/blob/master/JAVA_CLASS_GENERATOR/java_class_generator.py.
        
        # Installation
        
        pip install JAVA_CLASS_GENERATOR
        
        # How to Use the Executable File?
        
        First, open by double-clicking the file "java_class_generator". 
        How the executable file looks like is shown in the image below (the file is enclosed with a red rectangle).

        # Getting Started
        
        Once you run the application, you will first be asked whether you want to continue using the application 
        "Java Class Generator" or not. If you enter 'Y', you will be asked to enter more information about the Java class 
        you want to generate. Else, you will exit the application.

        # Information Entry
        
        The following pieces of information about the Java class you want to generate are required for you to enter.
        
        1. Name of the Java class
        2. Number of attributes in the Java class (including the name and type of each attribute)
        3. Number of methods in the Java class (including the name and return type of each method)
        
        # Java Class File
        
        Once you have entered all the required information about the Java class you want to generate, the code for the 
        Java class will be generated in the file named in the format "{Java class name}.java". For example, if the name 
        of the Java class is "Digimon", the code for the class is generated in the file "Digimon.java"

        After the Java class file is generated, you will be asked whether you want to continue using the application 
        "Java Class Generator" or not. If you enter "Y", you will be asked to enter information about another Java class you 
        want to generate. Else, you will exit the application.

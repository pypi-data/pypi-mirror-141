class HereditaryStratigraphicColumn:
    """Genetic annotation to enable phylogenetic inference among distributed
    digital evolution populations.

    Primary end-user facing interface for hstrat library. Should be bundled with
    digital genomes and propagated via the CloneDescendant method when passing
    those genomes from parent to offspring.

    Naming conventions are derived by analogy to Geological "Stratigraphy"
    (i.e., <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratigraphy>). The "hereditary
    stratigraphy" system provided by this software works by associating an
    identifier, referred to as a "stratum," with each elapsed generation along
    a line of descent. This allows two "columns" to be aligned to detect the
    generation of their most recent common ancestor: strata before the MRCA
    will be identical and strata after will differ.

    Stratum retention policy and stratum differentia bit width can be configured
    to tune the time and space complexity of the column, trading-off with
    uncertainty induced on estimates of phylogenetic distance back to the most
    common recent ancestor of two columns.

    Arbitrary user-defined data can be associated with strata by optional
    argument to the CloneDescendant method. (Note that a first stratum is
    deposited during column initialization, so an optional annotation argument
    may also be provided then.)

        If no mismatching strata are found but self and other have different

        The true rank of the first disparity with other is guaranteed to never
        be after the returned rank when confidence_level < 0.5.

        If the differentia width and confidence level are configured such that
        one or more suprious differentia collisions is plausible, this method
        will never return None.

        Consider two columns that compare identical at all common ranks. If
        these columns have few enough common ranks that all these collisions
        could plausibly be spurious then there is not yet enough to support
        common lineage between the columns so rank 0 must be selected as the
        estimated site of first retained disparity. If these columns have
        enough common ranks that all collisions could not plausibly be spurious
        then the largest rank that could not conceivably be spurious must be
        selected (and we are guaranteed such a rank exists). It is only when
        not even one collision could plausibly be spurious that strong enough
        evidence exists to conclude that there is no disparity.

        For example, the method may return None with 64-bit differentia and 95%
        confidence level but will never return None with 1-bit differentia and
        95% confidence level.

            With what actual confidence (i.e., more than requested) is the true
            rank of the MRCA captured within the calculated bounds?

        Notes
        -----
        The true rank of the MRCA is guaranteed to never fall above the bounds
        but may fall below.

        An alternate approach could be to construct the bounds such that the
        true rank of the MRCA will fall above or below the bounds with equal
        probability. This would involve setting the confidence level for
        calculating the first disparity with other to significance_level/2 and
        the confidence level for calculaing the last comonality with other to
        1 - significance_level/2. This means the confidence level applied to
        calculating the first disparity with other would always be <= 0.5.
        However, shifting the calculated first disparity with other below
        the definitive max first retained disparity requires confidence level
        >= 0.5. So, in practice such a symmetric approach would only result in
        the lower bound being shifted downward. For this reason, it is no longer
        provided as an option.

        In the absence of evidence to the contrary (i.e., more common
        strata than spurious differentia collisions alone could plausibly
        cause), this method assumes no common ancestry between self and other,
        returning None. This means that if few enough common ranks are shared
        between self and other (and the differentia bit with is small enough),
        it may not be possible to detect any common ancestry after accounting
        for the possibility of spurious differentia collisions (even if common
        ancestry did exist). So, calls to this method would always return None.
        Likewise, MRCAs at very early ranks may not be able to be reliably
        detected due to insufficient evidence. This can lead to cases where
        columns with true common ancestry have MRCA bounds estimated as None at
        much higher than the expected failure rate at the given confidence
        level. Note that with sufficient differentia bit width (i.e., so that
        even one collision is implausible at the given confidence level) this
        issue does not occur. Use CalcRankOfEarliestDetectableMrcaWith to
        determine the earliest rank at which an MRCA could be reliably detected

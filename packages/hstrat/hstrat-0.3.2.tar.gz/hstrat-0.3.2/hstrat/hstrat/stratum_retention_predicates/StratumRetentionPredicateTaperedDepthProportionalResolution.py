class StratumRetentionPredicateTaperedDepthProportionalResolution:
    """Functor to implement the tapered depth-proportional resolution stratum
    retention policy, for use with HereditaryStratigraphicColumn.

    This functor enacts the tapered depth-proportional resolution policy by
    specifying whether a stratum with deposition rank r should be retained
    within the hereditary stratigraphic column after n strata have been
    deposited.

    The tapered depth-proportional resolution policy ensures estimates of MRCA
    rank will have uncertainty bounds less than or equal to a user-specified
    proportion of the largest number of strata deposited on either column.
    Thus, MRCA rank estimate uncertainty scales as O(n) with respect to the
    greater number of strata deposited on either column.

    Under the tapered depth-proportional resolution policy, the number of strata
    retained (i.e., space complexity) scales as O(1) with respect to the number
    of strata deposited.

        retained or purged.

        Every time a new stratum is deposited, this method is called on each
        stratum present in a HereditaryStratigraphicColumn to determine whether
        it should be retained. Strata that return False are immediately purged
        from the column, meaning that for a stratum to persist it must earn a
        True result from this method each and every time a new stratum is
        deposited.

        This functor's retention policy implementation guarantees that columns
        will retain appropriate strata so that for any two columns with m and n
        strata deposited, the rank of the most recent common ancestor can be
        determined with uncertainty of at most

            bound = floor(max(m, n) / guaranteed_depth_proportional_resolution)

        ranks. Achieving this limit on uncertainty requires retaining sufficient
        strata so that no more than bound ranks elapsed between any two strata.
        This policy accumulates retained strata at a fixed interval until twice
        as many as guaranteed_depth_proportional_resolution are at hand. Then,
        every other retained stratum is purged gradually from back to front
        until the cycle repeats with a new twice-as-wide interval between
        retained strata.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stratum_rank : int
            The number of strata that were deposited before the stratum under
            consideration for retention.
        num_stratum_depositions_completed : int
            The number of strata that have already been deposited, not
            including the latest stratum being deposited which prompted the
            current purge operation.

        -------

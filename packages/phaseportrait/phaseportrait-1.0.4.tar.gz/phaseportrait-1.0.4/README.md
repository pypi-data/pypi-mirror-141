# What's this?
The idea behind this project was to create a simple way to make phase portraits in 2D and 3D in Python, as we couldn't find something similar on the internet, so we got down to work. Eventually, we did some work on bifurcations, 1D maps and chaos.

This idea came while taking a course in non linear dynamics and chaos, during the 3rd year of physics degree, brought by our desire of visualizing things and programming.

We want to state that we are self-taught into making this kind of stuff, and we've tried to make things as *professionally* as possible, any comments about improving our work are welcome!

**NEW on this version:** in order to make this package more friendly for new python users (or to non-coders), we've made a simple GUI for making 2D phase portraits. This new version includes managing files for this purpose, along with some minor performance upgrades on maps. If you are interested on checking the GUI, you can do it by viewing its GitHub repo ([https://github.com/phaseportrait/phaseportrait-gui/](https://github.com/phaseportrait/phaseportrait-gui/)) or in the phaseportrait documentation site ([https://phaseportrait.github.io/gui/](https://phaseportrait.github.io/gui/))

# Graph Weather
Implementation of the Graph Weather paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07575.pdf) in PyTorch.


## Installation

This library can be installed through

```bash
pip install graph-weather
```

## Example Usage

The models generate the graphs internally, so the only thing that needs to be passed to the model is the node features
in the same order as the ```lat_lons```.

```python
import torch
from graph_weather import GraphWeatherForecaster
from graph_weather.models.losses import NormalizedMSELoss

lat_lons = []
for lat in range(-90, 90, 1):
    for lon in range(0, 360, 1):
        lat_lons.append((lat, lon))
model = GraphWeatherForecaster(lat_lons)

features = torch.randn((2, len(lat_lons), 78))

out = model(features)
criterion = NormalizedMSELoss(lat_lons=lat_lons, feature_variance=torch.randn((78,)))
loss = criterion(out, features)
loss.backward()
```

## Pretrained Weights
Coming soon! We plan to train a model on GFS 0.25 degree operational forecasts, as well as MetOffice NWP forecasts.
We also plan trying out adaptive meshes, and predicting future satellite imagery as well.

## Training Data
Training data will be available through HuggingFace Datasets for the GFS forecasts. MetOffice NWP forecasts we cannot
redistribute, but can be accessed through [CEDA](https://data.ceda.ac.uk/).

        A Python package to aggregate and reduce water distribution network models
        
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        MAGNets is a Python package designed to perform the reduction and aggregation of water distribution network models. The software is capable of reducing a network around an optional operating point and allows the user to customize which junctions they would like retained in the reduced model. 
        
        Installation: Stable release
        --------
        
        To install MAGNets, run this command in your terminal:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           pip install magnets
        
        This is the preferred method to install MAGNets, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
        
        If you donâ€™t have pip installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide you through the process.

        Installation: From sources
        --------
        
        The sources for MAGNets can be downloaded from the Github repo.
        
        You can either clone the public repository:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            git clone git://github.com/meghnathomas/magnets
            
        Or download the tarball:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            curl -OJL https://github.com/meghnathomas/magnets/tarball/master
            
        Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            python setup.py install

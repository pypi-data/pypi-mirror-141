### A Python Machine learning library

A python machine learning library dedicated to simplicity and usability

MaPyL has the purpose of introducing a simple and functional machine learning library for those who don't want to spend days reading documentations.

The library doesn't currently have any releases or release dates.


### First release

The first release (0.1.0) will have the following features (or more):

- Linear, polynomial and logistic regression
- Classification
- Feature scaling 
- Support Vector Machines
- Clustering (K-means)

Of course the library will gain many features as it grows, here's a list of thing we want to include eventually (no promises though)

- Other kinds of regression
- Many more kinds of preprocessing
- Better clustering and SVM
- Neural networks (again, no promises)
- Datasets
  
## Contributing

Currently contributing is closed and we will not accept any contributions outside of our team.

This is because the library is still in  the very (very) early stages of development and there is still much work to be done, and random people working on the library at the same time as us won't help much right now, so hold your horses while we work on it.

# Leo Irakliotis' utilities for COMP 180

This package contains various utilities that I use in my
COMP 180 course at Loyola University Chicago. The course
is an introduction to Computing and Data for non computer-
science majors. It is based on Python and presents techniques
and methods using pandas/dataframes and matplotlib.

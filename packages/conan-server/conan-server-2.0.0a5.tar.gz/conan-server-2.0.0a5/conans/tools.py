"""
    Conan tools: classes and function in this module are intended to be used out of the box
    with the Conan configuration already currified into them. This configuration refers
    mainly to two items:
     - requester: on network calls, this will include proxy definition.
     - output: the output configuration

    Here in this module there should be no logic, all functions and classes must be implemented
    elsewhere (mainly in conans.util or conans.client.tools) and ready to be used without
    the currification.

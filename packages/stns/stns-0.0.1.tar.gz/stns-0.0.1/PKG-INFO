# stns
stns is a collection of various scripts used in the Nusbaum lab's python analysis.

How do I use stns?
-------------
stns is used primarily for spike detection and data visualizing, an example of loading the main GUI is shown below.
Various plotting functions can be found in the module plot.

```python
from stns import SpikeDetectionGUI

# Launch a spike detection gui
dir_name = '/Users/loganfickling/Downloads/Lingli_Data_Transferred/Data/05-22-07/'
f_name = 'b0p057-cond 2LPG killed-ions stim 3_6V 14hz-cogs off-LG PD LP_export.smr'
app = SpikeDetectionGUI(provided_path=dir_name + f_name) # Or don't pass a path and enter it manually
app.mainloop()

```

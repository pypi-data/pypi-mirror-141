### usage

first we need to import the sdk, the sdk offers a load_project method that loads an atp project and returns a scope containing the message_builder, the andi object and the channels.

- import either by ``import andisdk`` or ``from andisdk import load_project``
- create scope object ``scope = andisdk.loadproject(path_to_atp)`` or ``scope = loadproject(path_to_atp)``
- from the scope do any manipulation you need for example ``scope.message_builder.create_ethernet_message()``

#### Note
 channels are also added to scope, and are accessible via ``scope.channel_name``

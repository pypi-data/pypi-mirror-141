# Jarvis

   - Run the following commands in command line/terminal:
        - `cd lib && chmod +x installs.sh` - Makes [installation file](https://git.io/JBnPq) as executable.
        - `python3 -m venv venv` - Creates a virtual env named `venv`
        - `source venv/bin/activate` - Activates the virtual env `venv`
        - `which python` - Validate which python is being used. Should be the one within the virtual env `venv`
        - [`bash installs.sh`](https://git.io/JBnPq) - Installs the required libraries/modules.
        - [`python3 jarvis.py`](https://git.io/JBnPz) - BOOM, you're all set, go ahead and interact with Jarvis

### ENV Variables
Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file using the `python_dotenv` module.

</details>

### Smart Devices
A source file `smart_devices.yaml` can be used as a source for smart devices' IPs. `Jarvis` supports `MagicHome` lights and `LGWebOS` TVs.

By using `smart_devices.yaml`, the `Netgear` module can be avoided at the cost of manually updating the source file in case of IP changes.

> Note: Set a `SOURCE: True` flag in `smart_devices.yaml` otherwise the file will be removed in case of quick restarts.

### Automation Setup [Optional]
Executes pre-defined tasks at pre-defined times without any user interaction. Uses an `automation.yaml` file as source.

<details>
<summary><strong>Setup Instructions</strong></summary>

The YAML file should be a dictionary within a dictionary that looks like the below.

**OPTIONAL:** The key, `day` can be a `list` of days, or a `str` of a specific day or simply a `str` saying `weekday` or
`weekend` when the particular automation should be executed.

> Not having the key `day` will run the automation daily.

```yaml
6:00 AM:
  day: weekday  # Runs only between Monday and Friday
  task: set my bedroom lights to 50%
6:30 AM:
  day:  # Runs only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
  - Monday
  - wednesday
  - FRIDAY
  task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
8:00 AM:  # Runs only on Saturday and Sunday
  day: weekend
  task: set my bedroom lights to 100%
9:00 PM:  # Runs daily
  task: set my bedroom lights to 5%
```
</details>

# Market Data Providers

Miscellaneous APIs around Market Data providers.

## APIs

Currently only basic access to: <https://eodhistoricaldata.com/> is implemented.


## Build

This is built using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
# after checkout, within top-level checkout directory
poetry install

# To update dependencies, or after `poetry add ...`
poetry update

# to make sure we are using our virtual env's tooling (created
# automatically by poetry, much like conda env)
# We can, for example add ipython as a dev dependency, then shell into our
# env, only then will we get this install. Use `which ipython` to verify.
poetry shell

# To build distributable packages
poetry build
```

## Publishing

### To PyPi

Create PyPI account with a new token.

Add this to poetry's config:

```
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <my-token>
```

Simply publish:

```
poetry publish
```


### To Local Repository

Once off only: Prepare Local Repository

See: 

* https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/: Install this.
* https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/repositories/


```bash
# Create location
LOCAL_REPO_FS=$HOME/.local/home-pypi
mkdir -p $LOCAL_REPO_FS
cd $LOCAL_REPO_FS

# Run pypi-server in local repo fs, unauthorised mode.
pypi-server -i 127.0.0.1 -v -P . -a . -p 9292 .
```
Add repository name to `poetry` config:

```bash
poetry config repositories.home-pypi http://localhost:9292/
```
Update `pip` configuration to use this extra index.

```
# ~/.pip/pip.conf -> https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/#configuring-pip
# Add the following config

[global]
extra-index-url = http://localhost:9292/simple/
```

To publish to local repo:

```
# Publish distributable packages to local repo set-up with name above.
# Just press Enter when username asked, we don't have authentication on.
poetry publish --repository home-pypi
```

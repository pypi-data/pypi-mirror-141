# This is a special case for model data that is stored on your local machine.
# Index files are assumed to be in the same directory as the file with .idx appended to the file name.
# * For the moment, you can only have one "local" template.
# Since Herbie now accepts kwargs and passes them to self, you can template with any parameter,
# just remember to pass that parameter to the Herbie class ðŸ˜‹
